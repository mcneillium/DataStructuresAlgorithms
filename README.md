# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of fundamental data structures like trees, graphs, and hash tables, along with common algorithms associated with them. These implementations can be used as educational tools for understanding how these data structures work under the hood and how they can be applied to solve complex problems.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into directories, each focusing on a specific data structure or algorithm:

- **`trees/`**: 
  - Contains implementations related to tree data structures, such as binary trees.
  - Includes operations like insertion and traversal (e.g., inorder traversal).

- **`graphs/`**:
  - Contains implementations of graph-related algorithms.
  - Includes breadth-first search (BFS) for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

- **`hash_tables/`**:
  - Contains a basic implementation of a hash table.
  - Demonstrates how to handle key-value pairs with hashing and how to perform operations like insertion, lookup, and deletion.

## Features

- **Binary Trees**:
  - Implementation of a binary tree with methods for inserting nodes and performing an inorder traversal.
  - Demonstrates the hierarchical structure of data and recursive operations.

- **Graph Algorithms**:
  - Implementation of a graph with methods for adding edges and performing a breadth-first search (BFS).
  - Demonstrates how to traverse a graph layer by layer and is useful in scenarios like finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

- **Hash Tables**:
  - Implementation of a hash table using an array and a hashing function.
  - Demonstrates how to efficiently store and retrieve data using keys.

## How to Run the Examples

To run any of the provided examples, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataStructuresAlgorithms.git
     ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Specific Directory**:
   - Depending on the data structure or algorithm you want to explore, navigate to the corresponding directory:
     ```bash
     cd DataStructuresAlgorithms/trees
     ```

3. **Run the Python Script**:
   - Execute the Python script to see the data structure or algorithm in action:
     ```bash
     python binary_tree.py
     ```

   - For other examples, navigate to the respective directory (e.g., `graphs/`, `hash_tables/`) and run the relevant Python script.
