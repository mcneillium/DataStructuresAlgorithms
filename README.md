# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of fundamental data structures like trees, graphs, and hash tables, along with common algorithms associated with them. These implementations can be used as educational tools for understanding how these data structures work under the hood and how they can be applied to solve complex problems.

Additionally, the project includes a user-friendly GUI, created using Tkinter, that allows users to interact with these data structures and algorithms visually. This GUI is an excellent tool for educational purposes, providing a hands-on approach to learning.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into directories, each focusing on a specific data structure or algorithm:

- **`trees/`**: 
  - Contains implementations related to tree data structures, such as binary trees.
  - Includes operations like insertion and traversal (e.g., inorder traversal).

- **`graphs/`**:
  - Contains implementations of graph-related algorithms.
  - Includes breadth-first search (BFS) for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

- **`hash_tables/`**:
  - Contains a basic implementation of a hash table.
  - Demonstrates how to handle key-value pairs with hashing and how to perform operations like insertion, lookup, and deletion.

## Features

- **Binary Trees**:
  - Implementation of a binary tree with methods for inserting nodes and performing an inorder traversal.
  - Demonstrates the hierarchical structure of data and recursive operations.

- **Graph Algorithms**:
  - Implementation of a graph with methods for adding edges and performing a breadth-first search (BFS).
  - Demonstrates how to traverse a graph layer by layer and is useful in scenarios like finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

- **Hash Tables**:
  - Implementation of a hash table using an array and a hashing function.
  - Demonstrates how to efficiently store and retrieve data using keys.

  **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
  
  User-Friendly GUI:

  - A Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to interact with the binary tree, graph, and hash table implementations.
  
  - The GUI includes features like inserting nodes/edges, performing traversals, and displaying the current state of the data structures.
  
  Error Handling and Input Validation:

  - The GUI includes robust error handling to prevent common issues such as invalid inputs or operations on non-existent nodes.
  
  - Users are guided through the operations with helpful examples and clear instructions.
  
  Helpful Examples and Explanations:

  - The GUI provides examples for each operation, especially in the graph section, where users can see how to add edges and perform BFS with specific sample data.
  
  - Clear, concise explanations accompany each operation, making it easier to understand how the data structures and algorithms work.
